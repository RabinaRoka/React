###React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.


###React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript

###However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.
