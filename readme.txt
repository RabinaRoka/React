###React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.


###React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript

###However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.

##To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/* */} to wrap around the comment text.

##With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.


###One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className


###In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled.
